X.X [XXXX-XX-XX]

    New: OK/Cancel on JOptionPane will properly flip for right-to-left locales.

  Fixed: Toolbars anywhere in the window would drag the window - now only the top one does it.
  Fixed: Tree bounds extended to the right to allow clicking anywhere in the row, but that has
         to be to the left if the component orientation is right-to-left.

1.0 [XXXX-XX-XX TODO fill this in using metadata from the jar]
