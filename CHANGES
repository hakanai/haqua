    New: OK/Cancel on JOptionPane will properly flip for right-to-left locales.
    New: Clicking the expander no longer momentarily paints the expander far over the left of
         the tree when component orientation is right-to-left.
    New: Editable combo box no longer paints the text field in the wrong location when
         component orientation is right-to-left.
    New: Combo box popups now render in the correct orientation.
    New: When switching look and feel at runtime, segmented toggle buttons no longer lose
         their borders.
    New: List box dodges a NullPointerException which can happen in some cases when popped up
         from a combo box.
    New: JScrollPane and JScrollBar work correctly in right-to-left orientation.
    New: JPopupMenu's popup is set to the proper orientation.
    New: JMenuItem, JCheckBoxMenuItem, JRadioButtonMenuItem and JMenu paint in the proper
         location when in right-to-left orientation.
    New: JMenu paints the arrow the right way around when in right-to-left orientation.

  Fixed: Toolbars anywhere in the window would drag the window - now only the top one does it.
  Fixed: Tree bounds extended to the right to allow clicking anywhere in the row, but that has
         to be to the left if the component orientation is right-to-left.
  Fixed: Tree collapsed + selected icons painting in the wrong orientation for right-to-left.
  Fixed: IndexOutOfBoundsException on a JTabbedPane with no tabs.
  Fixed: Tree expand and collapse icons weren't animating because of a compromise made to get
         the right colour, but I have found a better trick to get the right colour, so the
         animation now works as well.
  Fixed: Baseline now matches for editable and non-editable combo boxes so that the top and
         bottom line up properly when using baseline alignment.
  Fixed: Editable combo boxes at small and mini size now properly line up the text field and
         button (the demo also now properly shows all three sizes.)
