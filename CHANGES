    New: OK/Cancel on JOptionPane will properly flip for right-to-left locales.
    New: Clicking the expander no longer momentarily paints the expander far over the left of
         the tree when component orientation is right-to-left.
    New: Editable combo box no longer paints the text field in the wrong location when
         component orientation is right-to-left.
    New: Combo box popups now render in the correct orientation.
    New: When switching look and feel at runtime, segmented toggle buttons no longer lose
         their borders.

  Fixed: Toolbars anywhere in the window would drag the window - now only the top one does it.
  Fixed: Tree bounds extended to the right to allow clicking anywhere in the row, but that has
         to be to the left if the component orientation is right-to-left.
  Fixed: Tree collapsed + selected icons painting in the wrong orientation for right-to-left.
  Fixed: IndexOutOfBoundsException on a JTabbedPane with no tabs.
